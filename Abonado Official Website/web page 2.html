        <p class="povdef">
            Poverty is a state where individuals or communities lack the financial resources and essentials for a minimum standard of living. It is characterized by insufficient access to food, clean water, shelter, and healthcare. Poverty can be absolute, where basic needs for survival are unmet, or relative, where individuals fall below the standard of living in their society. It is often associated with poor health, low education levels, and limited employment opportunities. Various factors, including economic instability, lack of education, and social inequality, contribute to the persistence of poverty.

Poverty also leads to social exclusion, where individuals or groups are marginalized and unable to participate fully in society. This exclusion can perpetuate cycles of poverty, making it difficult for future generations to break free. Additionally, poverty can exacerbate mental health issues, as the stress of financial insecurity takes a toll on individualsâ€™ well-being. Efforts to alleviate poverty often focus on improving access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Addressing systemic issues such as inequality and corruption is also crucial in the fight against poverty.
