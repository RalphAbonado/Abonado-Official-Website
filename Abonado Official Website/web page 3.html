        <h1>What are the Impacts of Poverty to our Society?</h1>

        <p class="pvrtfx">
            Poverty has profound and far-reaching effects on society. It exacerbates inequality, particularly along 
            gender and racial lines, as marginalized groups often face higher poverty rates. Education is significantly 
            impacted, with children from low-income families less likely to attend school or achieve high educational 
            outcomes, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Health outcomes are also poorer among those living in poverty,
             with limited access to healthcare leading to higher rates of illness and mortality. Mental health issues 
             are more prevalent, as the stress and uncertainty of poverty take a toll on psychological well-being. 
             Homelessness and inadequate housing are direct consequences, affecting individualsâ€™ stability and safety. 
             Hunger and malnutrition are common, particularly among children, leading to long-term developmental 
             issues. Economic productivity suffers as a significant portion of the population is unable to 
             contribute fully to the economy. Social cohesion is weakened, with higher crime rates and social 
             unrest often linked to areas with high poverty levels. Finally, poverty hinders overall societal 
             progress, as the potential of many individuals remains untapped, limiting innovation and growth. 
             Addressing poverty is thus crucial for creating a more equitable and prosperous society.
