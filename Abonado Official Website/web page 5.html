            If you have noticed, most of these countries are located in the Continent of Africa. Africa's status as the poorest 
            continent is due to a combination of historical exploitation, political instability, and economic challenges. The legacy of colonialism left many African nations with weak 
            institutions and economies, while ongoing political turmoil disrupts development and deters investment. 
            Additionally, the continent faces significant health issues, poor infrastructure, and low levels of education, 
            all of which hinder economic growth. Climate change further exacerbates these problems, impacting agriculture 
            and water resources, and contributing to persistent poverty.
